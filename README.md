This code is a part of a larger project on pdf data extraction and conversion to a proper datafile
I was facing an issue with taking large amounts of pdf data and converting them to excel data for a Natural Language Processing Task
With this code, the first step is done. 

## Two major packages are used: pandas and PyPDF2
### Note: To be able to convert data to excel, you must have pandas, PyPDF2 as well as something called 'openpyxl' installed already. 
### openpyxl will not require a separate import but must be installed first.
